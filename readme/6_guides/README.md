# QB Framework: Developer Guides

This section provides a collection of practical guides designed to help you effectively use the QB Actor Framework. Whether you're new to QB or looking to leverage more advanced features, these guides offer targeted advice, step-by-step instructions, and insights into best practices.

## Guides in this Section:

*   **[Getting Started with the QB Actor Framework](./getting_started.md)**
    *   Your first stop: A step-by-step tutorial to set up QB, build the framework, and run your first simple actor-based application.

*   **[QB Actor Framework: Design Patterns Cookbook](./patterns_cookbook.md)**
    *   Practical recipes and C++ examples for implementing common and effective actor-based design patterns such as Publish/Subscribe, Request/Response with Timeout, and Shared Resource Management.

*   **[QB Framework: Advanced Techniques & System Design](./advanced_usage.md)**
    *   Explore sophisticated usage patterns, advanced system design considerations (like complex actor hierarchies, supervision strategies, advanced message design), and strategies for tackling complex QB applications.

*   **[QB Framework: Performance Tuning Guide](./performance_tuning.md)**
    *   Learn how to optimize your QB actor applications for maximum speed, scalability, and efficiency with targeted tuning strategies for virtual cores, event messaging, actor design, and I/O.

*   **[QB Framework: Error Handling & Resilience Strategies](./error_handling.md)**
    *   A practical guide to designing robust actor systems by effectively handling errors at different levels (actor-internal, unhandled exceptions, I/O errors) and implementing application-level supervision patterns.

*   **[QB Framework: Effective Resource Management](./resource_management.md)**
    *   Best practices for managing resources like memory, file handles, and network connections within QB actors, primarily leveraging RAII and understanding the actor lifecycle.

## How to Use These Guides

*   **New Users:** Start with the "Getting Started" guide.
*   **Application Design:** Refer to the "Design Patterns Cookbook" and "Advanced Techniques" for structuring your actor systems.
*   **Optimization & Stability:** Consult the "Performance Tuning," "Error Handling," and "Resource Management" guides as your application evolves or when facing specific challenges.

These guides are intended to complement the conceptual documentation and the detailed API references, providing practical pathways to mastering the QB Actor Framework.
