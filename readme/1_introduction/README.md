# Introduction to the QB Actor Framework

Welcome to the QB Actor Framework! This section provides the essential starting points for understanding what QB is, why it was created, and the fundamental principles that guide its design. Whether you are new to actor systems or evaluating QB for your next C++ project, these pages will give you a solid foundation.

## Chapters in this Section:

*   **[QB Framework: A High-Performance C++ Actor Toolkit](./overview.md)**
    *   Discover what QB offers, its key capabilities for building concurrent and distributed systems, and who this framework is designed for.

*   **[QB Framework Philosophy: Building Modern C++ Systems](./philosophy.md)**
    *   Delve into the core design philosophies behind QB, including its reliance on the Actor Model, asynchronous I/O, performance, modularity, and developer productivity.

## Next Steps

After familiarizing yourself with this introductory material, we recommend proceeding to:

*   The **[Getting Started Guide](../6_guides/getting_started.md)** for a practical walkthrough of setting up and running your first QB application.
*   The **[Core Concepts](../2_core_concepts/README.md)** section to understand the fundamental building blocks like actors, events, and the asynchronous model in more detail.
